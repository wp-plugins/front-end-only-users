A customizable plugin lets users sign up to the front end only of your site with shortcodes for registration, login, profile editing forms and more.

== Description ==
This  plugin allows visitors to sign up as users on the front-end on any page of your website. It is completely customizable using CSS and is easily personalized with the use of shortcodes. These shortcodes can be used to insert registration, login, or profile editing forms on any page of your website and to restrict content. Users are created in separate tables so that they have no access to the back-end of your site. Create different fields for members to fill out and customize content based on their profiles. Customize forms with CSS to suit your needs using the Admin panel. Ideal for paid content, membership, dating sites and more!

= Key Features =

* Customizable membership fields
* Pure CSS-styled forms 
* Supports all input types for user fields
* Include different membership levels and restrict content accordingly
* Option to send sign-up emails and to require admin approval of users
* User input-based redirects
* Send user groups to different pages after login
* Personalize the experience of your site with the [user-data] shortcode
* UTF-8 support
* Front end features: registration, login, edit user profile, and account management
* Back end features: add new users, add new fields, add new levels, email settings and options

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `front-end-only-users` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place "[register]" on the page where you want your registration form to display
4. Place "[login]", "[logout]" and "[edit-profile]" shortcodes on pages as applicable
5. All four of the shortcodes accept an attribute, 'redirect_page', that lets you send users to a different page after submitting the form

--------------------------------------------------------------

- The user registration form can be customized from the admin panel, under the "Front-End Users" tab.
- Content can be restricted to users who are logged in using the [restricted][/restricted] tag. 
- You can further restrict content to a subset of users by adding "field_name" and "field_value" attributes to the restricted shortcode.
- For example, "[restricted field_name='Country' field_value='Canada']This is Canadian content.[/restricted]" would only display the line "This is Canadian content." to those who have put their "Country" as "Canada" on their user profile.
- You can also personalize your site using the [user-data] tag.
- By default the tag will return the user's Username, but can also display any other field (ex. [user-data field_name='First Name'])

= How do I add fields for my users to fill out? =

On the admin page, go to the "Fields" tab.
= How do I redirect based on a user field? =

You need to add the following attributes to your '[login]' or '[register]' shortcodes: ‘redirect_field’: the field the redirect is based off of (ex. Gender) and ‘redirect_array_string’: a comma separated list of pages to redirect to (ex. Male => http://ManPage.com, Female => http://WomanPage.com)
= How do I display a user's first name on a page? =

You can use the '[user-data field_name='First Name']' shortcode, assuming that you called your field "First Name" for a user's first name.
= How do I restrict content to visitors who have logged in? =

Content can be restricted using the '[restricted]'’[/restricted]' tag. Any content between the opening and closing tags will only be visible to those who are logged in.

= How do I approve an user? =

Click on the user you want to approve to see their details and there should be a radio button at the top of the page to approve the user.

= How do I restrict content based on the privilege levels? =

To restrict content to a certain level(X) your shortcode would be: ‘restricted level='X'’...content’/restricted’
For all levels above "X" level: '[restricted minimum_level='X''...content'/restricted]'
For all levels below "X" level: '[restricted maximum_level='X''...content'/restricted]'

= Once a user registers their information, is there a way to redirect them to a page that will have further instructions? =

You can add the attribute ‘redirect_page’ to the register tag to send newly registered users to a new page: '[register redirect_page='http://www.example.com']’

= When I go on the profile page, I see "You must be logged in to access this page." even though I'm already logged in. How can I fix this? =

Check the “Options” page, and make sure that 'Login Time' isn't blank. If it's blank, then you're only logged in for a second. Anything non-blank and higher than 0 should solve the problem.

= Is it possible to not the show message: "Sorry, this content is only for those whose FIELD is FIELD-value"? =

You can add the attribute ‘[no_message='Yes']’ to your shortcode, so it would look something like this: '[restricted field_name='Name' field_value='Alex' no_message='Yes''/restricted]'
= Is there a way to indicate to users that they are logged in? I know this can be added to a page using 'user-data', but is there a way to add it to the page header? =

You could add the ‘[user-data]’ tag to your header file and wrap it in restricted tags so that only logged in users can see it.

= I can't seem to find an option that requires a user to confirm his email upon registration. How do I add this feature? =

To add the confirmation link to the email, you need to include the shortcode ‘confirmation-link’ inside the body of your e-mail.

= How do I use the forgot password shortcode? =

You would want to create a separate page with the ‘[forgot-password]’ shortcode, and then another page with the ‘confirm-forgot-password’ shortcode on it. For the ‘[forgot-password]’ shortcode, you would then add an attribute ‘reset_email_url’ with a value set to whatever URL you're using for the ‘[confirm-forgot-password]’ shortcode.

=How do I restrict and redirect a user to the login page when user is not logged in? =

Content can be restricted using the ‘[restricted/restricted]’ tag. Any content between the opening and closing tags will only be visible to those who are logged in. To redirect a user when the user in not logged in you would want to use the ‘[login redirect_page='url']’ shortcode where the url is the login page you want to redirect to.

= How do I customize the style of this plugin? I'd like to change the color of my button. Can you let me know how I can do that? =

You can customize the plugin by adding code to the "Custom CSS" box on the "Options" page. For example, if you want the button to be red you might try adding:
‘.ewd-feup-submit.pure-button.pure-button-primary {background: red;}’

= How do I translate the plugin into my language? =
A great place to start learning about how to translate a plugin is at the link below: <http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/how-to-translate-a-wordpress-plugin>
Once translated, you'll need to put the translated mo- and po- files directly in the lang folder and make sure they are named properly for your localization.
If you do translate the plugin, other users would love to have access to the files in your language. You can send them to us at Contact@EtoileWebDesign.com, and we’ll be sure they’re included in a future release.
